        <h2>Hello friends!</h2>
            <p><br><br> Everyone has felt down and out at some point, and asking for help isn't always the easiest thing to do, especially if you're feeling vulnerable. Sometimes we don't have the courage to ask for help from friends or family nor the time to find a therapist.
            <br><br>This app is here to help! Anonymously ask questions, send encouragements, and vent your frustrations all in one place where others can see, respond, and help each other. This is a safe space for students to express themselves and ask for help.
            <br><br>That being said, there will be no tolerance for bullies or other negative comments from any groups or individuals. Your accounts can be compromised by getting enough reports from other users.
            <br><br> This is also by no means a replacement for real mental health counseling. If you feel too vulnerable, sad, or have thoughts of suicide, please reach out to different resources like the ones listed below. </p>
